  <p>All complaints show customer dissatisfaction about the quality of a product, that can be confirmed or not through a comprehensive investigation of batch history and sample analysis. An established complaint handling procedure takes into account at least four steps and it is not restricted to the Quality Assurance unit. It involves critical staff of the company, such as Marketing, Production, Quality Control, Finance, Regulatory and Legal Affairs.  In this way, a company that has a good complaint handling system can get an advantage over its competitors since it can improve the quality of its products and processes, establish a committed relationship with its customers, and be in compliance with the Good Manufacturing Practices.</p >
